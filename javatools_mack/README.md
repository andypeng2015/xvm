# Directory: ./javatools_mack/ #

This directory contains the "javatools_mack" aka "bottom turtle"
project, which is a tiny bit of Ecstasy code that is needed as
bedrock for the Java proof-of-concept. Specifically, both the 
compiler and the runtime need this tiny bit of code as a hidden
concrete solution to a technically impossible concept ("turtles
all the way down").

Regarding the name, "Mack" was the long-suffering bottom turtle
in the oh-so-high stack of turtles topped by the tyrant "Yertle",
ever so exquisitely documented by Dr. Seuss in the book "Yertle
the Turtle". Sadly, Mack Turtle passed away in 2022 at the ripe
old age of 96, after being run over by a "Freedom rally" truck
caravan. Rest in peace, Mack.
