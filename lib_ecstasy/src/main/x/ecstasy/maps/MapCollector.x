 * collects contents in a suitable manner (e.g. order may be important, hashing may be possible,
 * etc.), and then use that collected content to produce the desired class and form of `Map` (the
 * "finished product") in the [reduce] method.
 *
 * The default implementation collects data directly into the same `Map` that is returned as the
 * "finished product".
