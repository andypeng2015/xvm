# Versions
#
#    For subprojects, check the parent version .

# The XDK build has some convenience functionality - it will make sure that all ".properties" files
# for a particular project have their key/value pairs added to the environment of the project.
# The evaluation order is bottom-up, so that if a property is defined twice, the nearest defintion
# to the project is the one that will be implemented. This makes it possible to conveniently extend
# or replace any project properties that are inherited by subprojects.
#
# The last thing the XDK builder does is to check $GRADLE_USER_HOME for properties files, and parse
# them as will. To access the XDK artifact repository or any GitHub actions, a GitHub token is required.
# The token is a secret, so it should not be checked into the XDK repository build tree. This is not
# specific to GitHub, but all projects containing a repository name will be evaluated.
# You add credentials and user info to your $GRADLE_USER_HOME/gradle.properties file like so:
#
#   org.xvm.github.user=[GitHub user name]
#   org.xvm.github.token=ghp_[REDACTED]
#   org.xvm.github.repository.url=https://maven.pkg.github.com/xtclang/xvm (this is a default, and
#      not secret, so it's configured below)
#
# Other secrets that you should keep in the private properties file outside the build are
# code signing credentials, like so:
#
#   org.xvm.signing.keyId=[last 8 hex digits of private key 'sec' key in a GPG keyring]
#   org.xvm.signing.password=[password for your private GPG keyring]
#   org.xvm.signing.secretKeyRingFile=[path to your private keys, exported from the GPG keyring]
#
# (For more info about signed artifacts, please refer to the Gradle User Guide and the section on
#  the "signing" plugin.)
#
# The XDK distribution installed on your machine, now also contains a published plugin repo, of the
# same version as the XDK, which is currently required to have the same version as its plugin, until
# further notice (not intended to neccessarily remain so forever, but right now it's a convenience and¨
# stability thing until everything is industrial strength).
