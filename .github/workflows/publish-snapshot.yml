#
# This is intended to run for every changed pushed to master.
#
# It triggers every time something is pushed to master.
# It will only build SNAPSHOT publications
# It will publish SNAPSHOT publications to the XTC Lang GitHub Maven package repository.
# It will delete older SNAPSHOT publications if we have too many of them.
# Any consumer can refer to a SNAPSHOT version, a version pattern like 'any version after this', and to 'latest.integration' to use these.
#
# On push to master - update the snapshot artifact
# We also support manual release publication, which seems can't be triggred until merge to main
# However, we will check if the current VERSION file number already exists, and warn/skip the release
# action.
