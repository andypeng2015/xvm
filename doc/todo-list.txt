- CP/GG: update the CookieBroker doc regarding the cookies (SameSite, Secure etc.)

- CP/GG: prevent requests with "Sec-Fetch-Site=cross-site" from being processed except when an end point
     explicitly allows it (e.g. @AllowCrossSite)

- GG:
        String str;
        if (True) {
            str = "Hello, world!";
        }
        // str is not definitely assigned

- GG: Fix incorrect type inference: this should not compile:
        if ((i1 != Null) != (i2 != Null)) {
            return i1 + i2;
        }

- GG: allow super() call to have named arguments
        class Base {
            void f(String s, Int value = 1) = console.print($"{s=} {value=}");
        }
        class Derived extends Base {
            @Override
            void f(String s, Int value = 2) = super(s, value=3);
        }

- GG: allow type declarations for l-value to have "naked" annotations (without arguments), e.g.:
        @Parsed ElementNode node = ...
            instead of
        Parsed+ElementNode node = ...

    at the moment, the compiler doesn't allow it since there is no no-arg constructor for Parsed

- CP:
    void run() {
        console.print("no semicolon")
    }
    // would be nice as to have a simple "`;` is missing" error

- CP: Response.Cookie - not implemented and as such not used at all, do we still need it?

- GG: fix HttpClient talking to raw address (127.0.0.1 instead of localhost)

- GG: add batch commands support to cli

- GG: group CLI commands into sections (one per class? @CommandGroup?)

- GG: add compiler error for assigning non-transient properties for module or package

- GG: add typeExpected, typeActual to TypeMismatch exception

- consider an additional flavor of the createConnection API:
    static <Schema extends RootSchema> (oodb.Connection<Schema>+Schema) createConnection(
        Type<Schema> type, Directory dataDir, Directory buildDir,
        oodb.DBUser? user = Null, Version? version = Null) {

- GG: need to be able to do:
    class Test {
        String value = "a";
        void test() { Test.value ref = &value; ref.set("b"); }
    }
    Currently, one can do
        val ref = &value; ref.set("b");
    and "&ref.type.toString()" produces "Test.value"

- GG: BAST generation for "map[x] = y" is completely broken; additionally if a class has
      only a setter @Op("[]="), but no getter (@Op"[]") the compiler barfs

    class Test() {
        void test() {
            this["a"] = "A";
        }
        @Op("[]=") void put(String name, String value) {}
    }

- CP: how to prevent a DoS attack by a "curl" loop to overwhelm the session cache

- CP: do we need a UrlEncoder (similar to Java's)?

- CP: add API support for multi-part body, for example (Body.x):
    conditional Body[] multipart() = False;

- CP: add formatting control to FPNumber.toString() and/or introduce
        "FPNumberFormat implements Format<FPNumber>" similar to Java's
        DecimalFormat. Also, could add something like Java's CompactNumberFormat

- GG: add the following method to Tuple
        /**
         * Obtain a `List` view of this Tuple. Note, that the type check will be performed only
         * during element extraction, not when this call is made.
         *
         * @param  the type of the element in the list
         *
         * @return the list view
         */
        <ElementType> List<ElementType> asList(Type<ElementType> elementType = Object)

- GG: consider allowing to debug an eval expression (debug eval)

- GG: consider changing Service.callLater() API to
    <Result> Future<Result> callLater(function Result doLater());

- add a method to Map API to evaluate the "worst lookup cost" based on the current content
  (Mark's suggestion to evaluated keys' hashCode distribution)

- compiler to report on ambiguous type parameter name across a virtual child and its parent(s)

- add deadlock detection

- would be nice if we could figure out how to compute the inferred types for regular cases and the
    residual type for the "default" switch case, e.g.:

    Boolean test(Boolean|Int value)
        {
        switch (value)
            {
            case True, False:
                return value;      // the compiler could figure out the value is a Boolean
            default:
                return value > 0;  // the compiler could figure out the value is an Int
            }
        }

- CP: consider a compiler warning if a return value of Closeable type is ignored (@Adopt annotation)

- add compiler support for conditional Tuple

- consider adding a V_GET opcode that would combine the functionality of L_GET and MOVE_THIS for
  dynamically inflated (via & ref) or non-inflated properties; it would eliminate the need for
  corresponding compensation in ClassTemplate.getPropertyValue() and OpInvocable.getCallChain()
  (submission "Fix Ref handling for non-inflated properties" of 8/9/2022)

- GG: optimize-out unnecessary array cloning by changing getBytes() to copyBytes(arrayInto)

- consider @Proxyable annotation for compiler to enforce proxy-ability of an interface

// DEFERRED:
- classes in methods don't support captures of formal types
- @Atomic property with a mutable content needs to wrap
- what if timer.schedule() lambda throws? (exception is invisible)
- infinite loop detection
- upon a Future's gc report if an exception has not been handled
