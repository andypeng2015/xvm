- Stack overflow (fiber depth + frame depth within a fiber or cross-fiber frame depth)

- Move op-code: "safe wrapper" logic

- ServiceContext - the "register..." APIs are "fiber local" -- unless called from the outside

- native optimization Stringable methods on xInt*, xUInt*, etc.

-- tuple support
   - InvocationExpression - needs to generate _xT ops (i.e. it must be able to testFit & validate for a tuple type)
   - verify (and test) the logic in ReturnStatement that gens RETURN_T
   - assignment w/ multi-LVal needs to testFit for Tuple if testFit for multi fails
     (and use Expression.packedExpression and unpackedExpressions for code gen?)

- Lazy property on an immutable object must not produce a mutable value

- compiler to verify that const properties are Orderable

- compiler to verify "all or nothing" implementation for funky interfaces

- use unique name for private properties
    {
    const Point(Int x, Int y)
        protected/private Int x;
        private Int y;

        void report()
            {
            console.println($"x={x}; y={y}");
            }
        }

    const NamedPoint(String name, Int x, Int y)
            extends Point(2*y, x + 1)
        {
        @Override
        void report()
            {
            console.println($"x={x}; y={y}"); // not the same y
            super();
            }
        }
    }

- run-time to validate that immutable objects passing through the "membrane" belongs to the
  recipient's type system

- generic type resolution for a turtle type should be Tuple<Type<A>,Type<B>, ...> instead of Tuple<A, B, ...>

- When we resolve CompileType.Key (where CompileType is known to be Map), we produce
    FormalTypeChildConstant based on the CompileType formal property.
  When we resolve PublicType.OuterType formal type, we produce that same FormalTypeChildConstant even
  though it now applies to the Type of the formal type.
  To figure it out, FormalTypeChildConstant tries both paths to resolve itself.
  In the second scenario we should produce TypeOfConstant(), which could be an IdentityConstant
  based on a FormalConstant or a Register (for dynamic types);
  it would return pool.clzType().getComponent() from getComponent() method, and resolve the
  type according to the content as Type<X>.

- optimize TypeConstant.resolveTypedef()


$$$$$$$$$$ DEFERRED ISSUES $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

- TemplateRegistry and TypeComposition could be mutated by different threads
    (hence the use of ConcurrentHashMap in TemplateRegistry and synchronization in TypeComposition)

- DelegatingIterator could use delegation, but how to describe the delegating type?

- is there a way to avoid and auto-generate "T x = this.x" in if/for/switch statements that
  would benefit from type inference; see AnnotationExpression.x#toString(), ImportStatement.x#toString()

- when there are two invocations in the row or a new followed by an invocation, we could analyze the
  expressions right-to-left and do the type inference if all those expression are "fluent" style
  For example, consider OrderedMapSlice.reify() method:

    @Override
    OrderedMap<Key, Value> reify()
        {
        return new SkiplistMap<Key, Value>(size, orderer).putAll(this);
        }

  It would be quite nice if the compiler could infer the return type from the fluent method and
  allowed as to skip the formal types:

        return new SkiplistMap(size, orderer).putAll(this);
