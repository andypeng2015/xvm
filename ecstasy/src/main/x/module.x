/**
 * This is the archetype Ecstasy module, the seed from which all Ecstasy code must derive,
 * and the foundation upon which all Ecstasy code builds. This module contains the Ecstasy
 * type system, defining each of the intrinsically supported data types, and the various
 * structures and capabilities of the Ecstasy type system and runtime environment.
 * Additionally, a number of useful data structures and algorithms are included to promote
 * the productivity of developers writing Ecstasy code.
 *
 * All Ecstasy modules import this module automatically, as if they had the following line
 * of code:
 * <code>import ecstasy.xtclang.org as x;</code>
 *
 * This module is fully and completely self-referential, containing no references to other
 * modules, and no link-time or runtime dependencies.
